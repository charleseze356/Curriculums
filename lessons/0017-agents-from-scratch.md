    steps:
      - "Copy the `Agent` and `Tool` classes from this lesson"
      - "Add a `self_critique` tool that the agent can call when it wants to evaluate its own draft answer: it sends the draft to a second LLM call and returns a quality score (1–10) and improvement suggestions"
      - "Give the agent a system prompt that says: \"When answering complex questions, always call self_critique on your draft before giving the final answer. Only accept a draft with score ≥ 7.\""
      - "Test on a complex question (e.g. \"Explain the tradeoffs between microservices and monoliths for a 5-person startup\") and observe whether the agent self-critiques and improves its answer"
      - "Log each iteration including whether self_critique was called and what score it returned"
    expected: "An answer to the test question preceded by a log showing the iteration sequence and the self-critique score."
    why: "Self-critique is a real pattern used in production (it's the evaluator-optimizer from Lesson 14, implemented as a tool the agent itself decides to call). Building it into the raw agent class shows how frameworks compose these patterns transparently."

## Motivation

LangGraph, PydanticAI, and every other framework you have seen are built on top of the same raw API calls you have been writing since Lesson 2. Knowing what those frameworks do under the hood — and being able to reproduce it without them — makes you a better engineer and a better debugger. When a framework behaves unexpectedly, engineers who know the underlying loop fix the problem in minutes. Engineers who only know the framework spend hours.

This lesson walks through a complete, production-shaped agent implementation in plain Python with nothing but the OpenAI SDK and Pydantic — the exact foundation every agent framework builds on.

{% include prereqs.html %}

## What a framework actually does {#what-a-framework-actually-does}

When you write a LangGraph workflow or a PydanticAI agent, the framework does exactly four things for you:

1. **Assembles the messages list** — it builds the system prompt and history that goes to the API.
2. **Runs the loop** — it calls the LLM, inspects the response for tool calls, executes them, and appends results.
3. **Manages state** — it stores the evolving context (history, tool results, flags) somewhere between iterations.
4. **Handles stopping** — it decides when the loop ends (no more tool calls, max iterations, error).

None of these require a framework. They are straightforward Python. A hand-rolled agent is often *shorter* than a framework-based one for simple use cases, and always more debuggable.

## A complete agent implementation {#complete-agent}

The following is a production-shaped agent class. It wraps everything you built across Lessons 12–14 into a single, reusable component:

```python
import json
import os
import time
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Callable, Any
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

            }
        }

    def execute(self, arguments_json: str) -> str:
        args = json.loads(arguments_json)
        try:
            result = self.fn(**args)
            return str(result)

        except Exception:
            return f"[{reason}] No partial result available."
```

## Using the agent {#using-the-agent}

Define tools as `Tool` objects, instantiate the agent once, and call `run()` for each task:

```python
import datetime

# ── Define tools ────────────────────────────────────────────────

tools = [
    Tool(
        name="get_current_date",
        description="Return today's date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).",
        parameters={"type": "object", "properties": {}, "required": []},
        fn=lambda: datetime.date.today().isoformat(),
    ),
    Tool(
        name="calculate",
        description="Evaluate a safe arithmetic expression. Example: '2 + 2 * 10'.",
        parameters={
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "expression": {"type": "string", "description": "The arithmetic expression"}
            },
            "required": ["expression"],
        },
        fn=lambda expression: str(eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}})),
    ),
]

# ── Create and run ───────────────────────────────────────────────

agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    system_prompt=(
        "You are a research assistant. Use your tools to gather information. "
        "Always cite sources and acknowledge uncertainty."
    ),
    tools=tools,
    max_iterations=8,
    timeout_s=60.0,
)

answer = agent.run(
    "What is today's date? Also, if a $1000 investment grows 7% per year, "
    "how much is it worth after 10 years?",
    verbose=True,
)
print(answer)
```

## Adding persistent memory {#adding-memory}

The `Agent` above is stateless between `run()` calls — each call starts fresh. For conversational agents, you want to carry history across runs. The minimal approach:

```python
class ConversationalAgent(Agent):
    """Extends Agent with cross-run memory."""

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self._history: list = []

    def chat(self, user_message: str, verbose: bool = False) -> str:
        answer = self.run(user_message, verbose=verbose)

        # Update history
        self._history.append({"role": "user",      "content": user_message})
        self._history.append({"role": "assistant",  "content": answer})

        # Trim to last 20 turns to stay within context window
        if len(self._history) > 40:
            self._history = self._history[-40:]

        return answer
```

This is the same pattern that every chat SDK and framework uses — they just wrap it in more abstraction. Seeing the raw version makes it trivial to debug context window issues, trim strategies, and memory bugs.

## When to roll your own vs use a framework {#when-to-roll-your-own}

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Simple agent, 2–5 tools, single step | Raw API — fewer moving parts |
| Agent inside a larger application | Raw API — cleaner integration |
| Strict type guarantees on result | PydanticAI — typed result enforcement |
| Complex branching, persistence, human-in-the-loop | LangGraph — built for this |
| Debugging a framework agent | Reproduce the failing case with raw API first |
| Teaching or onboarding a team | Raw API first — then introduce a framework once the team understands the fundamentals |

<div class="callout info">
<strong>Industry note:</strong> Many production AI systems at companies like Stripe, Linear, and Notion are built on raw API calls with a thin custom agent class — not on LangChain or LangGraph. Frameworks are valuable tools, not requirements.
